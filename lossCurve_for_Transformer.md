#### Figure 1. Loss Curve of Training and Validation for Transformer on 2D Burgers equation. Here, the model has converged and no overfitting is detected throughout the process. The lowest validation loss is 0.028 at Epoch 163 and the training process stops at Epoch 664. The loss show minimal fluctuations in later stages, suggesting convergence near the optimal solution with limited room for further improvement.
